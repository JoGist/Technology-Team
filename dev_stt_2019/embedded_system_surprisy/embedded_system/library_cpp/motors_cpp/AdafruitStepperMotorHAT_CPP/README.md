This is a simple port of the Adafruit Stepper Motor HAT library, originally in Python

Use this library at your own peril! I believe everything was ported correctly, but you never know. If you find a bug, feel free to contribute.

Make sure you have libi2c-dev installed, i.e. "sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev"

Type "make" to compile 

"./StepperMotorTest" to run as stepper motor

"./DCMotorTest" to run as DC motor
